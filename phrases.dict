# Dictionary for use with the Polari Bible Ver. 7
# This version extracts the individual books which is stores as
# intermediate pickle files. (This is understandable as if the Bible
# is to be placed on-line then folks will only want to retrieve it
# a book at a time.) These pickle files are then converted to .rhtml
# files which are then subsequently converted to HTML.
#
# I *think* the way forward is to have two separate components: the
# first reads the raw text of the Bible, splits it in to books, 
# chapters and verses and then translates it. 
#
# This data structure can then either be pickled or passed to whatever
# output formatting engine (PDF, HTML, e-reader...) is desired.
